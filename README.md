==================================

Ai Module x Screens Course - year 02023

The field of artificial intelligence is in flux with very exciting and sometimes terrifying developments happening every week. This module is a very hands on designerly approach to give you the tools, references, histories, etc. so you can feel the pulse of the field. The module is thematically in 3 weeks:

* 13.March to 20.March -> Ai x LastWeek 
* 21.March to 27.March -> Ai x ThisWeek  
* 28.March to 31.March -> Ai x NextWeek 

## Ai x LastWeek
This week we learn about Ai and its short but complex history. First we will spend some days having fun with [P5.js](https://p5js.org/), a javascript library for creative coding that has lots of Ai and Machine Learning examples. At the end of the week we will explore Ai and Machine Learning by redesigning and mixing lots of existing code. 

### Monday 13.March
**Intro++**

We will be using [p5.js](http://www.p5js.org/), a JavaScript framework for creative coding. No need to use anything other than Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and the web [P5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) -> **Please make an account!**

There is also the possibility of running everything on your own computer -> https://p5js.org/get-started/ (scroll all the way down)

In the morning we will be learning about the basics of programming in p5.js + how make things interactive + loops.

### Thursday 16.March
**P5.js Design**

Today will be a full hands-on day building on code from http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/

Mini-task : design an interactive and dynamic sketch.

Let's make a gallery in the classroom with everyone's computer showing their sketch - Presentations at 15:00! 

Resources: 
* Lots of examples and videos about p5.js : https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2017/blob/master/README.md?plain=1


### Friday 17.March
**Ai x ML **

We start with a lecture on Ai for Interaction Designers where we will learn about Ai history, Machine learning (ML) and 3 main applications of ML : Clusterers, Classifiers and Regressors. We will play with examples of these three categories during the hands on part of the lesson. 


* [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/)
* [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com)
#### Sequential classifier models
* [Sentiment analysis in p5js](https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/Sentiment_Interactive)
* [Quick, Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)


### Monday 20.March 
**GenerativeAi** 

This session will focus on another main application of ML : Generators. We will focus on the production of Images and Text by running models on Runway ML and Google Colab.

* [Runway ML](https://runwayml.com/)


## Ai x ThisWeek
The rest of this week will be devoted to engaging with the two most releant content generation tools in the current Ai landscape: ChatGPT and Dalle-2. We will use these systems as case studies of complex Ai systems that need to be interacted with through text snippets or prompts. The design of prompts is not a straightforward affair so we will spend some time learning how to better match the descriptions with the content we want to produce. 

### Wednesday 22.March
**Prompt Design**

Today will be about generative ai with mainstream tools and some theories about prompt design. 

### Thursday 23.March
**Hands-on Day**

Developing good prompts takes practice so today will be a full on hands-on day where you can develop your skills. 

### Friday 24.March
**Prompt Battle**

Time to show your prompt skills! We will compete against each other using text-to-image software and find out who can create the most amazing, disturbing or hilarious images. There will be prizes!

Voting categories:
- Disturbing
- Hilarious
- Beautiful 
- Ridiculous

## Ai x NextLastWeek

In the last week of the course we turn ourselves towards the ultra-near-future. What lies around the Ai corner? We will learn about Ai ethics and speculative design with a focus on potential intersections between Ai and Design. 

### Monday 27.March
**Ai Ethics**


### Wednesday 29.March
**Speculative Ai Design**

### Thursday 30.March
**Design Day**

### Friday 31.March
**Presentation and Wrap up**
