Ai Module x Screens Course - year 02023

The field of artificial intelligence is in flux with very exciting and sometimes terrifying developments happening every week. This module is a very hands on attempt to give you the tools, references, histories, etc. so you can feel the pulse of the field. The module is thematically in 3 weeks:

* 13.March to 20.March -> Ai x LastWeek
* 21.March to 27.March -> Ai x ThisWeek
* 28.March to 31.March -> Ai x NextWeek

## Ai x LastWeek
This week we learn about Ai and its short but complex history. First we will spend some days having fun with [P5.js](https://p5js.org/), a javascript library for creative coding that has lots of Ai and Machine Learning examples. At the end of the week we will explore Ai and Machine Learning by redesigning and mixing lots of existing code. 

### Intro++ (Monday 13.March)

We will be using [p5.js](http://www.p5js.org/), a JavaScript framework for creative coding. No need to use anything other than Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and the web [P5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

There is also the possibility of running everything on your own computer -> https://p5js.org/get-started/ (scroll all the way down)
